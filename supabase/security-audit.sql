-- Run this with a Supabase project owner/database role.
-- The connected Supabase integration currently does not grant schema-inspection/DDL
-- permissions for this project, so this audit script is committed for repeatable verification.

-- 1) Tables exposed through public schema and their RLS state.
select

  c.relname as table_name,
  c.relrowsecurity as rls_enabled,
  c.relforcerowsecurity as rls_forced
from pg_class c
join pg_namespace n on n.oid = c.relnamespace
where c.relkind = 'r'
  and n.nspname = 'public'
order by c.relname;

-- 2) Existing policies.
select
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'public'
order by tablename, policyname;

-- 3) Storage buckets.
select id, name, public, created_at, updated_at

-- 5) Confirm the PB162 admin helper uses immutable app_metadata only.
